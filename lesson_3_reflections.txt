1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you would want to share your work with others as well as working with others
    on the same project.
    
2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The commits may have changes that are not fully operational, thus resulting in a branch
    that have many non-logical commits.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A fork is used to make a copy of a repository while giving credit to the owner of the original
    repository. A clone is used to make a copy of a repository of GitHub on your local machine.
    A branch is used when you want to make other experimental changes before deciding that it
    should be a part of the application or before the feature is operational. A fork is useful
    to be able to push to a repo while also giving credit to the original owner(s). A clone
    is useful if you are a contributer to a repo that you are cloning. A branch is
    useful for testing and developing new features that want to be added.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
