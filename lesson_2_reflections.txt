1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created in the current directory which stores the metadata for the

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
		What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows what files are going to be a part of the next commit and is

	you are in and the repository is where the files are committed after they
	have been added to the staging area.
